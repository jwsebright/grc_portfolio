# Joe Sebright â€” GRC Engineering & Cybersecurity Portfolio Hub

### ðŸ‘‹ About

**Senior GRC Engineer** focused on building **automated, auditable, and human-centered compliance programs**.  
I specialize in translating complex frameworks (NIST 800-53, 800-171, CSF, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GLBA, FERPA) into **technical controls**, **risk automation**, and **policy-as-code implementations** that improve governance efficiency and security outcomes.

## Vision

This repository showcases my work and philosophy on **GRC Engineering**, where governance, risk, and compliance intersect with automation and technical implementation.  

My goal is to bridge the gap between traditional compliance frameworks and modern engineering practices by demonstrating how to **operationalize controls**, **automate evidence collection**, and **embed compliance into infrastructure**.  

Iâ€™m passionate about creating practical, scalable solutions that make compliance more transparent, efficient, and impactful for higher education and public-sector organizations.

## About Me

I'm **Joe Sebright**, a **Senior Policy and Risk Analyst** with the **University of Illinois System Office**, focusing on **GRC engineering, cybersecurity policy, and risk automation**.  

My work spans the intersection of **governance, security architecture, and privacy**, helping translate compliance frameworks into technical and operational controls that teams can actually implement and measure.

### What I Do

- **GRC Engineering & Architecture** â€“ Build and align control frameworks (NIST 800-53, 800-171, CSF) with cloud and on-prem systems.  
- **Policy Design & Implementation** â€“ Develop and maintain policies to ensure systemwide compliance at the University of Illinois.  
- **Risk Management & Automation** â€“ Streamline assessment and mitigation processes using modern GRC tooling and data-driven reporting.  
- **Security Governance** â€“ Guide implementation teams toward standardized, auditable controls that meet privacy and regulatory obligations.  

### Career Highlights

- **GRC Engineering Leadership**: Lead security and compliance initiatives aligned with NIST and privacy frameworks.  
- **Policy Development**: Co-authored and revised key cybersecurity and privacy policies for the University of Illinois.  
- **Risk & Compliance Automation**: Focused on integrating compliance processes with automation tools and AWS-native services.  
- **Incident Preparedness**: Designed tabletop exercises and control testing frameworks to strengthen resilience and governance readiness.  
- **Higher Education Security**: Advocate for scalable, collaborative approaches to cybersecurity and compliance in public institutions.
