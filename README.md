# GRC Professional Portfolio: Joe Sebright

## About Me

Hello, I'm **Joe Sebright**, a Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) professional and cybersecurity policy analyst with extensive experience in **higher education security governance**. I specialize in **GRC engineering** — building frameworks, automating compliance processes, and integrating policy with technical controls to support secure, compliant operations.

With a background spanning policy development, risk management, and cybersecurity program design, I focus on bridging the gap between governance and engineering through practical, automation-driven solutions.

## Professional Summary

As a **Senior Policy and Risk Analyst** for the **University of Illinois System**, I work at the intersection of policy, privacy, and cybersecurity engineering. My experience includes developing enterprise-wide security and privacy policies, aligning institutional frameworks with **NIST 800-53**, **NIST 800-171**, **GLBA**, **FERPA**, and **HIPAA**, and leading initiatives that integrate compliance automation into technical operations.

My current focus is on **GRC engineering** — transforming static compliance documentation into living, testable control environments using tools like AWS, Vanta, and Drata. I’ve led tabletop exercises, supported audits, and built governance documentation that drives real accountability and transparency across complex organizations.

## Career Journey

### GRC Engineering at the University of Illinois System (Present)

My current work involves:

1. **Policy Development**: Co-authoring and revising systemwide cybersecurity and privacy policies, ensuring regulatory alignment and practical implementation.  
2. **Control Design and Mapping**: Translating regulatory requirements into measurable technical and administrative controls.  
3. **Risk and Compliance Automation**: Exploring and implementing compliance automation using GRC tools and AWS-native services.  
4. **Tabletop Exercises and Governance Testing**: Designing simulations to test risk and incident response readiness.  
5. **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Working with privacy, audit, and IT leadership to unify governance and accountability across the system.  

Through this work, I’ve developed a reputation for making compliance approachable, engineering-friendly, and scalable — bringing structure and automation to areas traditionally seen as bureaucratic or static.
